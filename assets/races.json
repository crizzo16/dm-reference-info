Encountering them is practically dissying for first-time visitors to a maw: their eerily transparent bodies flash with dim organic lights, shapeshifting into vague form and imperfect copies of various creatures, all accompanied by a strange hum or blurbles and tones. Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.", "Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cutting-edge intersection of science and arcana.", "Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply discovered on the maws. Some speculate that the amoeboids evolved there among the advanced technology, but just as many support the theory that amoeboids were designed and purposefully placed on the maws."]

After all, nothing so fantastic could be a mere coincidence; the maws are a ready-made transit network, connecting the far reaches of the galaxy, complete with a resident race of shapeshifters intelligent enough to understand them and skilled enough to maintain them. Indeed, most races would likely have never discovered Dark Matter technology without observing the maw stations firsthand. Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giant, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.", "More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop collasal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable may portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it's unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?", "For their part, the amoeboids have few ansers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are an inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed \"zero\" generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.", "It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear. Perhaps the Grand Mystery has been intentionally obscured by a powerful creator or creators, or perhaps all involved are missing some critical piece, some insight that links the amoeboids, the maws, and their enigmatic creation."]

This single database, a collection of nearly everything known to them, is a scientific marvel, a monument to all amoeboid achievement.", "To this day, amoeboids are the only race that maintains a non-involvement policy in their visits to other worlds, keeping their distance, observing remotely when possible, and experimenting only when disturbance can be minimized. The sole exception to non-involvement is with spacefaring races that have journeyed to the maws themselves; the amoeboids greet such groups as equals, and welcome them with access to the galactic community."]

Hailing from Kemet, a harsh, desert planet, crosscrossed by rivers and lakes, they have always known an appreciation for the sun's blessings and cruelties, which forms the backbone of their religion, inspires their arts and sciences, and informs their view of the cosmos. Their dogma centers squarely on their dity and holy star, the Sun Above, to which there can be no equal", "When the avia-ra took their first tentative steps into spaceflight, however, their religion bent and adapted to the wider universe in which they found themselves. Suddenly, their Sun Above was no longer Deshret, the star around which their homeworld orbits, but a theoretical \"true star\" from which all stars, including thier own, derive meaning. It was centuries before they ventured to the centured to the center of the galaxy and encountered what they consider the physical embodiment of the Sun Above: The Sepulcher Star.", "In those days, the Spulcher Star orbited much further from the black hole at the galactic core, and it was definitevly under elven control. The avia-ra soon learned from the elves that the Sepulcher Star wasn't merely a star, but contained some sort of supermassive construct within. Though strictly an academic curiosity to elves, this discovery galvanized the avia-ra: in the heart of this star, near the exact center of the galaxy, was their Sun Above. Over the next few centuries, the avia-ra quietly bolstered and gathered their fleets in preparation for the First Crusade.", "This was the first of many Crusades, bloody battles between the avia-ra and the elves for control of the center of the galaxy. Each crusade was puncuated with the signing of a treaty, a respite from battle, and a consolidation of forces. Always, a surprise attack by one of the two sides reignited the conflict anew. In the Third Crusade, the avia-ra constructed the massive Solar Citadel in orbit around the Spulcher Star&#8211;a holy city, built for the glory of the Sun Above and to deter elven aggression. In short order, it was seized by an elven sneak attack; ever since, the Citadel has become a flashpoint for conflict and a central focus for Crusades."]

After all, their pantheons are extensive and integral to their societies; a monotheistic god has little place among them. Instead, the avia-ra have turned to primitice civilizations, especially those on undiscovered planets with which to share their message.", "The pattern for their evangelism is simple: build a civilization on an undeveloped world, founded on the philosophy of their solar religion, reside with it long enough to ensure it leaves a lasting legacy, and depart once again for the stars. In the avia-ra religion, all worship of the sun is indirectly worship of the Sun Above, so any evolution their gods of light and flame take on with the passing of centuries is inconsequential; they are still effigies of Old Un in the Sepulcher Star.", "This practice is controversial, to say the least. Many worlds have ancient tales of travelers from other worlds, bringing with them the blessings of the Sun, and these depictions paint them much like gods themselves. Humans, especially, have a sore spot for this sort of unfair proselytizing&#8211;High Terra was an early target for avia-ra evangelists. Elves and dwarves hold their own pantheons as sacred, and concemn avia-ra missionaries as a whole, but there is little that the galactic community can do, short of inciting glactic war.

The high gravity of their homeworld strengthens their bones and ensures their short, stocky sature, and a life spent doing industrial labor toughens their muscles into steel.", "Dwarven expansion into space took a somewhat different route than most, in that there was little in the way of war or conquest. Ages before they discovered spaceflight, the dwarves had already founded the beginnings of the Conclave, which drove the interests of their entire race under one banner. When they began expanding out into the galaxy at large, they found that, although Jormund was host to all manner of life, the surrounding systems were barren. What they lacked in inhabitants, however, they made up for in mineral wealth. True to their nature, the dwarves turned their skill, magic, and technology towards the mining of these planets, and converted the influx of material into the largest mining and freighting fleet in the galaxy.

The details of the old cataclysm are lost to time, for conflicting stories tell of different disasters, from a war caused by the greed of an ancient dwarven king, to the folly of an invention crafted by a mad blacksmith, to the poisonous breath of a spiteful dragon which contaminated the skies.", "Despite being sequestered away under the surface, the subterranean dwarven cities are true marvels of engineering. Their tunnels stretch deep into the planet,some reaching nearly to its core.
