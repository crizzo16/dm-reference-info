Though the universe excels in producing creatures of diverse shapes and sizes, the amoeboids are something truly unique.", "Moreover, amoeboids are gifted with exceptional intelligence, and many possess a natural talent with machines. They were among the first space-bound races (the first, if one considers their origin), and remain pioneers in Dark Matter technology. Most amoeboids place tremendous faith in scientific reasoning, to the extent that a sound statistical model will often be more convincing than reported events. This, of course, extends to magical research, and amoeboid technology rests at the cutting-edge intersection of science and arcana.", "Such unique humanoids ought to come from an equally unique homeworld, but this is not the case; amoeboids were simply discovered on the maws.

Every technological discovery is built on the shoulders of giant, but in this case, the giants have gone mysteriously absent.", "More perplexing is that the maws are not merely technological in nature; they are constructed atop collasal skeletons of long-dead creatures. The bones themselves seem critically important, for it is impossible to create a stable may portal without them, but what role they play is completely baffling to researchers. Moreover, it's unclear what type of creature left the bones, for nothing alive today even remotely resembles them. Are these creatures extinct, or simply yet undiscovered? Do they originate from inside the galaxy, or even from within our universe?", "For their part, the amoeboids have few ansers to the Grand Mystery; their origins are an inscrutable to them as anyone else. The earliest amoeboid records date to the first instances of amoeboids learning how to interface with maw terminals and record data, perhaps a century after the supposed \"zero\" generation. Before that is a short but impenetrable dark age stretching back to the activation of the maws and obscuring their origin.", "It is in their nature to search for answers from a scientific frame of reference, but real evidence has been elusive so far. Speculation points to Old Un being involved in the Mystery, but what role he played is unclear.
