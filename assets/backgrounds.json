Technologists are experts in repairing, tuning, and decommissioning the devices that other people rely on for their employment, comfort, and safety. Therefore, they are in constant demand everywhere, from heavily-industrialized foundry worlds near the galactic core, to the Frontier worlds on the rim. Moreover, any ship of significant size is likely to employ engineers to keep it flying, regardless of where it finds itself in the ‘verse.", "Technologists come in all shapes and sizes, so there are lots of reasons why they might become adventurers. It could be that they are drawn to the challenge, or that they seek to uncover arcane secrets that can be incorporated into their machines. Some might have gotten their start as hired helpers for an established adventuring party, while a surprising number turn to druidry, having become so sick of malfunctioning technology that the only option is to cut it out of their lives altogether!"],
